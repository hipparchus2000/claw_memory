## Research Phase Updated:

### Three Research Areas:
1. **Social Listening** (30%)
   - What people are talking about
   - Topics of interest and engagement

2. **Technical Research** (40%)
   - **Focus**: Whisper STT on Linux/Raspberry Pi 5
   - Camera integration, computer vision
   - AI memory system developments

3. **Money-Making Research** (30%)
   - iOS/Android app market trends

   - Monetization strategies
   - Niche opportunities

## Example Drop-ins Tomorrow:

### Technical (Whisper STT):
> "Speaking of Whisper on Linux, I found it runs **2-3x real-time on Raspberry Pi 5** with only **75MB memory usage**. The whisper.cpp implementation is optimized for ARM."

### Business (App Market):
> "That app discussion reminded me - **productivity apps are growing 30% year-over-year**, with subscription models averaging **$8-12/month**. Health & fitness apps are close behind at 25% growth."

### Investment:
> "Since we were talking investments, **angel investors typically invest $25K-100K for 5-10% equity** in early-stage tech projects. **Government grants** offer $50K-500K non-dilutive funding for AI projects."

## Next Steps:

### Immediate (Tomorrow):
1. **Research phase** will include Whisper STT + money-making research
2. **Social listening** will track conversations about Linux, apps, investments
3. **Prepare natural drop-ins** for relevant discussions

### Short-term (This week):
1. **Complete Whisper STT research** (due Mar 1)
2. **Start app market analysis** (due Mar 3)
3. **Test insight dropping** in conversations
4. **Begin social memory scanning** prototype

### Medium-term (March):
1. **Design Conversation Gardener** (due Mar 10)
2. **Explore investment options** (due Mar 5)
